# Retro-net

This project aims to enable old devices to access the web of today, or the web of yesterday using archive.org caches.  
The aim is mostly Windows CE devices, but things here will work for other devices as well.

Goals:

 * Strip SSL from any web request
 * Reddit
 * Hacker News
 * Linux shell access
 * Instant messenger access
